SESSION STORAGE:
- has access to a session storage object. where data in the localStorage doesn't expire data in sessionStorage is cleared
when the page session ends
- a page session last as long as the browser is open, and survives over and restores. opening a page in a new tab or
window creates a new session. opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window
Closing a Tab/window end the session and clears objects in sessionStorage.

- if we had an id value, it would be easy. we would just store the value of the imgage in session storage under the id
property. Deleting would then be as easy as just deleting that
- so I think the solution is to just store the image under the name of its self, then if we want to delete or call it we
just call the image value.
